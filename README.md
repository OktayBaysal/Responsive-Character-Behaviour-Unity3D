# Responsive-Character-Behaviour
  I realized that all the characters I created felt clunky, rough and unresponsive. Controls always required button smashing and perfect timing.
I thought there were no problem with the scripts that I wrote. But when I brainstormed and researched how I can solve the problem, that was an enlightenment.

  My character can walk, run, dodge roll (strafe to the sides and dodge step when locked to enemy), combo three attacks and make a parry move.
